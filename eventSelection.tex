\section{Event Selection\label{sec:eventSelection}}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:SUSY}, all-hadronic SUSY signatures consist of events with
no isolated objects apart from energetic jets. One can quantify the
total visible energy in these type of events with the quantity, \scalht, defined as 
the scalar sum of the transverse energy of the jets in the event. The challenges due to large
backgrounds in a search for an excess in all-hadronic events becomes evident 
when comparing observed data events overlaid with simulated events from 
SM processes as a function of \scalht, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HT-distribution}.

           models are not under study in this analysis.}

The dominant background consist of azimuthally-balanced (i.e, back-to-back in the azimuthal angle 
$\phi$) multijet events, stemming from QCD processes. This search reduces this background 
to negligible levels in the hadronic search region by employing the \alphat variable further 
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:alphat}. Furthermore, by construction, \alphat also reduces 
backgrounds from mis-measured back-to-back jets. The remaining significant backgrounds are 
SM process with genuine \met. The expected yield of these backgrounds are measured using two 
control samples. The following sections describe the identification of objects used in the 
hadronic and control samples, while the detailed description of the background and control 
samples are left for Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}.

\subsection{Data}
The data analyzed was recorded by CMS in 2012 between April 5th and December 5th and
amounts to 19.47$\pm$ 0.5 \fbinv at the center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 8~\TeV$. 
The collected data is certified on a run-by-run basis, where initial automatic certification 
requires the LHC beams to be declared stable and all CMS subdetectors ON. Further monitoring 
of the data was done in real-time by experts of each subdetector trough analysis of 
histograms updated and filled each luminosity section. Final certification was done offline, 
and only luminosity sections passing all criteria for good quality are used in this analysis.

\subsection{Event quality\label{sec:met-filters}}

Each event is subjected to a series of commonly used filters in CMS to ensure good
data quality. Minimal requirements are that at least one primary vertex is identified 
and 25\% of the reconstructed tracks to be of good quality. Additionally, various event 
cleaning filters prescribed by the MET group~\cite{ref:MET-filters} are applied. These 
filters reject events containing known problems, such as: muons with inconsistent energy or 
muons created by beam-gas interactions, spurious noise spikes in the calorimeter, tracking
failures, and calibration laser events overlapping with physics collisions.

\subsection{Object vetoes\label{sec:vetoes}}

The background in this search can be separated into two types: 
reducible and irreducible. The latter refers to backgrounds that 
have the same final state as the signal and therefore any cut imposed 
to reduce the background processes would also reduce the signal. The process 
\znunu + jets is the only irreducible background in this search. 
All other backgrounds are reducible, meaning that if no information 
in the event is lost and all cuts were fully efficient, the background 
could be eliminated without loss of signal. To suppress \wj and \ttbar
events, this analysis uses vetoes object to reject events where a W boson 
decays to a neutrino and a lepton. Events containing 
an isolated electron (Sec.~\ref{sec:recElectron}) with $\pt > 20\GeV$ 
and $|\eta| < 2.5$ or an isolated muon (Sec.~\ref{sec:recMuon})
with $\pt > 10\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$ are vetoed. In order to keep this 
search all-hadronic and not overlap with other analyses in 
CMS~\cite{CMS-PAS-SUS-14-008,photon7TeV}, events with isolated 
photons (Sec.~\ref{sec:recPhot}) with $\pt > 25\GeV$ 
and $|\eta| < 2.5$ are also rejected. Events with a single isolated 
track (Sec.~\ref{sec:recSIT}) and no object associated with it can indicate that
a lepton was ``lost'' (i.e. either fallen out of acceptance or poorly 
reconstructed), hence such events are also vetoed. Detector and selection 
inefficiencies restrict the complete elimination of reducible backgrounds, 
as such, the method to estimate expected SM yields in the hadronic search
region is described in Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}.

\subsection{Hadronic pre-selection}

Events are categorized into two jet multiplicities: $\njetlow$ and 
$\njethigh$.  Each event in these categories is further  by the number
of jets identified as originating from b quarks ($\nb$). Events having 
three or more b-tagged jets are not considered in the analysis.      
Significant hadronic activity in the events is ensured by requiring
$\scalht > 375\GeV$. As described in Section~\ref{sec:signal_triggers}, events are further
categorized in 100~\gev bins in \scalht starting from $\scalht = 375\GeV$ and ending with 
an open-ended bin $\scalht > 1075~\gev$. The two highest-$\pt$ jets are 
subject to a higher threshold, $\pt>100\gev$, and the highest-$\Et$ jet 
is subjected to a tighter $\eta$ acceptance requirement, $|\eta| < 2.5$. 
The variables \scalht and \mht are computed from the number of jets, 
\njet, that satisfy the \pt requirements listed in Table~\ref{tab:jet-pt-thresholds}. 

\begin{table}[h!]

    All other jets &  50~\gev  \\
    \hline
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\input{alphat}

\subsection{Final selections\label{sec:finalSelections}}

After applying the \alphat selection described in Section~\ref{sec:alphat}, 
the remaining events are expected to have little contamination 
from balanced multijet QCD events, i.e. at the sub-percent level. Furthermore, QCD events with mismeasured jets are
largely rejected since they fall below the \alphat threshold.  However, 
two types of rare backgrounds from multijet events can lead to values of \alphat 
greater than 0.55. The first is a rare circumstance in which several jets with similar 
values of the azimuthal angle ($\phi$) fail to pass the jet \pt threshold. 
Such jets would not be considered in the calculation of \scalht and as a result, 
they would bias the \mht calculation low. The events are rejected by comparing the 
\mht  with the missing transverse energy, $\pfmet$ as defined in~\ref{sec:recMET}, such that events 
with $R_{\rm miss}=\mht/\pfmet > 1.25$ are rejected.
The second type of rare background is the severe mismeasurment of jets 
that are absorbed by inefficient crystals in the ECAL. These crystals, 
which make up 1\% of the total crystal count, give only partial record 
of the energy deposited thereby introducing ``fake'' \mht in the event. 
As a filter, the quantity:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dphistart}
  \bdphi\, \equiv \,\Delta\phi \left(\vecp_{\rm j}, -\sum_{i\neq j} \vecp_{{\rm i}}\right)\,,
\end{equation}

ie. the azimuthal distance between a jet and the \mht calculated when not considering the jet,
is evaluated for all jets with $\Pt>30$~\gev.  Small values of $\bdphi$ indicate jets 
that contributed most to the \mht.  For each jet with $\bdphi <$ 0.5, the number of dead
ECAL cells within $\Delta R \left(\vecp_{j},cell\right) < 0.3$ is counted. If the number exceeds 
9 for any jet, then the event is rejected. 

\subsection{Key distributions for the hadronic search
  region\label{sec:mc-data-comp}}

Yields from simulation are not used in absolute terms to estimate
background counts from SM processes, but rather only as ratios. The
signal and control samples are defined to be kinematically similar,
thus any biases arising from mismodelling within the simulation are
expected to largely cancel. However, it is nevertheless important to
demonstrate the quality of the MC simulation, which is done with the
data--MC comparison plots described below.
