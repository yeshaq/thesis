\section{Event Selection\label{sec:eventSelection}}

As discussed in section~\ref{sec:SUSY}, all-hadronic SUSY signatures consist of events with
no isolated and detectable objects apart from energetic jets. One can quantify the
total visible energy in these type of events with the quantity, \scalht, the scalar sum of 
the transverse energy of the jets in the event. The challenges due to large
backgrounds in a search for an excess in all-hadronic events becomes evident 
when comparing observed data events overlaid with simulated events from 
SM processes as a function of \scalht, figure~\ref{fig:HT-distribution}.

           models are not under study in this analysis}

The dominant background are azimuthally-balanced (i.e. back-to-back in the azimuthal angle 
$\phi$) multi-jet events, stemming from QCD processes. This search reduces this background 
to negligible levels in the hadronic search region by employing the \alphat variable further 
discussed in section~\ref{sec:alphat}. Furthermore, by construction, \alphat also reduces 
backgrounds from mis-measured back-to-back jets. In the absence of the multi-jet QCD events,
the remaining significant backgrounds are SM process with genuine \met. The expected 
yield of these backgrounds are measured using two control samples. The following sections
describe the identification of objects used in the hadronic and control samples, while the 
detailed description of the background and control samples are left for 
chapter~\ref{sec:background}.

\subsection{Data}
The data analyzed was recorded by CMS in 2012 between April 5th and Dec. 5th and
totals 19.47$\pm$ 0.5 \fbinv. The collected data is certified on a run-by-run 
basis, where initial automatic certification requires the LHC beams to be declared
stable and all CMS subdetectors ON. Further monitoring of the data was done in real-time
by experts of each subdetector trough analysis of histograms updated and filled
each luminosity section. Final certification was done offline, and luminosity sections passing
all criteria were listed in a Golden JSON file to be used by all analyses. 

\subsection{Event quality}

Each event is subjected to a series of commonly used filters in CMS to ensure good
quality data. Minimal requirements are that at least one primary vertex is identified 
and 25\% of the reconstructed tracks to be of good quality. Additionally, various event 
cleaning filters prescribed by the MET group~\cite{ref:MET-filters} are applied. These 
filters reject events containing known problems, such as: muons with inconsistent energy or 
muons created by beam-gas interactions, spurious noise spikes in the calorimeter, tracking
failures, and calibration lasers polluting overlapping with physics collsions.

\include{trigger}

\subsection{Object vetoes}

Standard Model processes with genuine \met from escaping neutrinos can
also produce leptons. Vetoing events with reconstructed leptons help suppress
this background.  Events containing an isolated electron~\cite{PAS-EGM-10-004} 
with $\pt > 20\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$ or an isolated muon~\cite{PAS-MUO-10-002}
with $\pt > 10\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$ are vetoed. In order to keep this search
all-hadronic and not overlap with other analyses in CMS[REF], events with isolated
photons~\cite{PAS-EGM-10-006}  with $\pt > 25\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$ are also rejected.
Events which have a single isolated track~\ref{sec:sit} but no object 
associated with them are also rejected.

\subsection{Hadronic pre-selection}

Events are categorized into two jet multiplicities: $\njetlow$ and 
$\njethigh$.  Each event in these categories is further binned by the number
of jets identified as originating from b quarks ($\nb$). Events having 
three or more b-tagged jets are not considered in the analysis.      
Significant hadronic activity in the events is ensured by requiring
$\scalht > 375\GeV$. As described in section~\ref{sec:trigger}, events are further
binned in 100~\gev bins starting from $\scalht = 375\GeV$ and ending with an open-ended
bin $\scalht > 1075~\gev$. The two highest-$\Et$ jets are subject to a 
higher threshold, also detailed in
Table~\ref{tab:jet-pt-thresholds}, and the highest-$\Et$ jet is
subjected to a tighter $\eta$ acceptance requirement ($|\eta| <
2.5$). The variables \scalht and \mht are computed from the number of
jets, \njet, that satisfy the \Et requirements listed in
Table~\ref{tab:jet-pt-thresholds}.

    All other jets &  50.0  \\
    \hline
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\include{alphat}

\subsection{Final selections\label{sec:finalSelections}}

After applying the \alphat selection~\ref{sec:alphat}, the remaining 
events are expected to have little contamination from balanced QCD events.  
Furthermore, events with back-to-back measured jets are also rejected. Nonetheless
two topological cases still need to considered.

Protect from accepting events with \mht due to jets with similar values of 
the azymuthal angle ($\phi$) that fail to pass the jet Et threshold. Such jets would
not be considered in the calculation of \scalht and as a result, they would bias the 
\mht calculation. The events are rejected by comparing the \met calculation from 
jets as defined in~\ref{sec:reconstruction} with the missing transverse energy, 
$\pfmet$, and events with $R_{\rm miss}=\mht/\pfmet > 1.25$ are rejected.

The other, is a protection from severe mismeasurments of jets that are absorbed
by masked crystals in the ECAL. These crystals, which make up 1\% of the 
total crystal count, give only partial record of the energy deposited thereby introducing
``fake'' \mht in the event. As a filter, the quantity:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dphistart}
  \bdphi\, \equiv \,\Delta\phi \left(\vecp_{\rm j}, -\sum_{i\neq j} \vecp_{{\rm i}}\right)\, .
\end{equation}

ie. the azimuthal distance between a jet and the \mht calculated when not considering the jet,
is evaluated for all jets with $\Pt>30$~\gev.  Small values of $\bdphi$ indicate jets 
that contributed most to the \mht.  For each jet with $\bdphi <$ 0.5, the number of dead
ECAL cells within $\Delta R \left(\vecp_{j},cell\right) < 0.3$ is counted. If the number exceeds 
9 for any jet, then the event is rejected.
