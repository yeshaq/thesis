\subsection{Definition of \texorpdfstring{\alphat}{AlphaT}\label{sec:alphat}}

Multijet events stemming from QCD contribute overwhelmingly to
all-hadronic events recorded by the detector. Generally, these multijet events
have no significant imbalance in transverse energy and can 
be reduced with a requirement for high-\met. Yet, this approach is difficult, 
as the calculation of \met is sensitive to detector effects and conditions, 
and additionally, in the high-\met phase space systematic uncertainties become difficult
to control. The variable, \alphat, introduced in 2008 by Randall and 
Tucker-Smith~\cite{Randall:2008rw} effectively suppresses multijet 
events with no significant \met without relying on the measurement
of \met. By construction it also introduces robustness against mismeasurements 
of transverse energies in multijet systems.  In the simplest case of a two-jet system,
\alphat is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:alphat}
\alphat\, =\, \frac{\Et^{{\rm j}_2}}{M_\text{T}} \, ,
\end{equation}

where $\Et^{\rm j_2}$ is the transverse energy of the less energetic
jet and $M_\text{T}$ is the transverse mass of the dijet system,
defined as

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mt}
  M_\text{T}\, = \,\sqrt{ \left( \sum_{i=1}^2 \Et^{{\rm j}_i}
    \right)^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^2 p_x^{{\rm j}_i} \right)^2 - \left(
      \sum_{i=1}^2 p_y^{{\rm j}_i} \right)^2} \, = \,\sqrt{\scalht^2 + \left(\mht\right)^2} \,  .
\end{equation}

where the three terms, $\Et^{{\rm j}_i}$, $p_x^{{\rm j}_i}$, and $p_y^{{\rm j}_i}$ are,
respectively, the transverse energy and $x$ or $y$ components of the
transverse momentum of jet ${\rm j}_i$. By definition, the sum over the first term is
\scalht and the sums over the other two terms define \mht. In well 
measured dijet events, transverse momentum conservation requires 
the $\pt$ of the two jets to be of equal magnitude and back-to-back 
in the plane transverse to the beam. The value of \alphat for these 
type of events can be best seen after transforming 
Equation~\ref{eq:mt} into CMS coordinates:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mt-polar}
  \alphat\, = \,\frac{\Et^{{\rm j}_2}}{\sqrt{2\Et^{{\rm j}_1}
   \Et^{{\rm j}_2} \left(1-cos\left(\Delta\phi\right)\right)}}\, .
\end{equation}

Well balanced back-to-back jets have \alphat values of 0.5. 
For the case of an imbalance in the measured transverse energies 
of back-to-back jets \alphat is reduced to values smaller than 0.5, 
this gives the variable its robustness with respect to jet energy 
mismeasurements. In the case where the two jets are not back-to-back 
in the transverse plane but rather the dijet system balances genuine 
\met, for example in leptonically decaying W boson recoiling off a 
system of jets, the values of \alphat can exceed 0.5.
Figure~\ref{fig:alphat_dist} shows the \alphat 
distribution in two jet multiplicity bins for events passing 
an \scalht trigger and basic pre-selection requirements. Multijet 
events from QCD drop to negligible levels above $\alphat>$ 0.55
while events with genuine \met continue to populate bins in excess
of  $\alphat>$ 0.55.

            This figure is for illustrative purposes only, as this analysis relies
            on data control samples to estimate contribution from SM process

An extension of \alphat can be made for events containing three or more jets
by clustering the jets into two pseudo-jets~\cite{cms-pas-sus-09001}. 
A pseudo-jet's $\Et$ is calculated as the scalar sum of the contributing 
jets' transverse energy, while the total transverse energy of the system, \scalht, 
is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse energy of the pseudo-jets: 
$\scalht = \Et^{{\rm pj}_1}+\Et^{{\rm pj}_2}$.
All combinations of the n-jet system are tested, and the configuration which
balances the constructed pseudo-jets' \Et is chosen, i.e. the combination which
minimizes $\dht = \Et^{{\rm pj}_1}-\Et^{{\rm pj}_2}$. As balanced multijet events
are expected to have small \dht, this simple clustering criterion provides the best
separation between multijet events and events with genuine \met. 
Equation~(\ref{eq:alphat}) can therefore be generalized as:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:alphat2}
  \alphat\, = \,\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{\scalht -
    \dht}{\sqrt{\scalht^2 - \mht^2}} \, = \,\frac{1}{2} \times 
  \frac{1 - (\dht/\scalht)}{\sqrt{1 - (\mht/\scalht)^2}} \, . 
\end{equation}

In the limit that  $\dht \rightarrow 0$, the ratio of missing energy and
visible energy can be expressed as a function of \alphat:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:alphat3}
  \frac{\mht}{\scalht} \, = \, \sqrt{ 1 - \frac{1}{4 \cdot \alphat^2} }
\end{equation}

This analysis uses an \alphat threshold of 0.55, which results in accepting
events having more than 40\% percent as much missing transverse energy as visible transverse
energy. For an event with $\scalht=$~375~\gev, this amounts to nearly 160 GeV in \mht.  
%For reference, under the assumption of $\dht = 0$, the values of
%$\alphat = 0.55$, 0.60, and 0.65 map onto values of the ratio
%$\mht/\scalht = 0.42$, 0.55, and 0.64.
