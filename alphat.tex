\section{Definition of \texorpdfstring{\alphat}{AlphaT}\label{sec:alphat}}
%
%The \alphat~\cite{Randall:2008rw, RA1Paper} variable is used to
%efficiently reject multijet events without significant \met or with
%transverse energy mismeasurements, while retaining a large sensitivity
%to new physics with final-state signatures containing significant
%\met.
%
%The measurement of \met typically relies on independent sources of
%information from each of the calorimeter, tracking, and muon
%subdetectors~\cite{cms-met}. Relative to other physics objects, this
%measurement is particularly sensitive to the beam conditions and
%detector performance. This difficulty is compounded by the
%high-energy, high-luminosity hadron collider environment at the LHC
%and the lack of precise theoretical predictions for the kinematic
%properties and cross sections of multijet events. Hence it is very
%challenging to control and model accurately the multijet background in
%the high-\met phase space that is typical of SUSY searches.
%
%Given these difficulties, the variable \alphat was developed to avoid
%direct reliance on a measurement of \met, instead depending solely on
%the measurements of the transverse energies and (relative) azimuthal
%angles of jets, which are reconstructed from energy deposits in the
%calorimeter towers~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}.  The variable is
%intrinsically robust against the presence of jet energy
%mismeasurements in multijet systems.
%%and is observed to be robust against the effects of pileup. 
%For dijet events, the \alphat variable is defined
%as~\cite{Randall:2008rw, RA1Paper}:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:alphat}
%\alphat\, =\, \frac{\Et^{{\rm j}_2}}{M_\text{T}} \, ,
%\end{equation}
%
%where $\Et^{\rm j_2}$ is the transverse energy of the less energetic
%jet and $M_\text{T}$ is the transverse mass of the dijet system,
%defined as
%
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:mt}
%  M_\text{T}\, = \,\sqrt{ \left( \sum_{i=1}^2 \Et^{{\rm j}_i}
%    \right)^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^2 p_x^{{\rm j}_i} \right)^2 - \left(
%      \sum_{i=1}^2 p_y^{{\rm j}_i} \right)^2} \, .
%\end{equation}
%
%where $\Et^{{\rm j}_i}$, $p_x^{{\rm j}_i}$, and $p_y^{{\rm j}_i}$ are,
%respectively, the transverse energy and $x$ or $y$ components of the
%transverse momentum of jet ${\rm j}_i$.
%
%For a perfectly measured dijet event with $\Et^{\rm j_1} = \Et^{\rm
%  j_2}$ and jets back-to-back in $\phi$, and in the limit in which the
%momentum of each jet is large compared with its mass, the value of
%\alphat is 0.5. For the case of an imbalance in the measured
%transverse energies of back-to-back jets, \alphat is reduced to a
%value smaller than 0.5, which gives the variable its intrinsic
%robustness with respect to jet energy mismeasurements. Values
%significantly greater than 0.5 are observed when the two jets are not
%back-to-back and are recoiling against significant, genuine \met.
%
%The definition of the \alphat variable can be generalised for events
%with two or more jets as follows. The mass scale of the physics
%processes being probed is characterised by the scalar sum of the
%transverse energy $\Et$ of jets considered in the analysis, defined as
%$\scalht = \sum_{i=1}^{\njet} \Et^{{\rm j}_i}$, where \njet is the
%number of jets with \Et above a predefined threshold. The estimator
%for \met is given by the magnitude of the transverse momenta
%$\vec{\pt}$ vectorial sum over these jets, defined as $\mht =
%|\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm jet}} \vec{\pt}^{{\rm j}_i}|$.
%
%For events with three or more jets, a pseudo-dijet system is formed by
%combining the jets in the event into two pseudo-jets. The total \Et
%for each of the two pseudo-jets is calculated as the scalar sum of the
%measured \Et of the contributing jets. The combination chosen is the
%one that minimises the absolute \Et difference between the two
%pseudo-jets, \dht. This simple clustering criterion provides the best
%separation between multijet events and events with genuine
%\met. Equation~(\ref{eq:alphat}) can therefore be generalised as:
%
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:alphat2}
%  \alphat\, = \,\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{\scalht -
%    \dht}{\sqrt{\scalht^2 - \mht^2}} \, = \,\frac{1}{2} \times 
%  \frac{1 - (\dht/\scalht)}{\sqrt{1 - (\mht/\scalht)^2}} \, . 
%\end{equation}
%
%In the presence of jet energy mismeasurements, the direction and
%magnitude of the apparent missing transverse energy, \mht, and energy
%imbalance of the pseudo-dijet system, \dht, are highly correlated.
%This correlation is much weaker for R-parity-conserving SUSY with each
%of the two decay chains producing the LSP.
%
%It is useful to consider the limiting case $\dht \rightarrow 0$ to
%understand the relationship between \alphat and the ratio \mht/\scalht:
%
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:alphat3}
%  \frac{\mht}{\scalht} \, = \, \sqrt{ 1 - \frac{1}{4 \cdot \alphat^2} }
%\end{equation}
%
%For reference, under the assumption of $\dht = 0$, the values of
%$\alphat = 0.55$, 0.60, and 0.65 map onto values of the ratio
%$\mht/\scalht = 0.42$, 0.55, and 0.64.
