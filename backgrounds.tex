\section{Background estimation for processes with genuine \texorpdfstring{\met}{MET}\label{sec:backgrounds}}

After applying the full hadronic selection, the remaining backgrounds are SM
processes with genuine \met in the final state. In the category of zero b-tagged 
jets, the two primary background are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \zj; where the Z vector boson decays into a pair of neutrinos, 
\item \wj; where the W vector boson either undergoes a leptonic decay and the lepton is ``lost''
or it undergoes the weak decay $\wtaunu$ where the $\tau$ decays into quarks and 
\end{itemize}

a ``lost'' lepton is defined as any lepton that isn't reconstructed or 
fails the isolation or acceptance requirements. Other SM backgrounds, 
such as the diboson production, single-top and Drell-Yan are expected.

for events with one or more b-tagged jets, \ttbar production where each
quark decays into a b-quark and a W vector boson which in turn decays into 
a lost lepton and neutrino becomes a large background source.

%For events with only one reconstructed
%b-quark jet, the contribution of both W + jets and Z + jets
%backgrounds are of a similar size to the \ttbar background.  
For events with two reconstructed b-quark jets, \ttbar production
dominates the background. 

Two control samples are used to estimate the background. To esimate the
\znunu + jets background, $\gamma$ + jets events, which have the same
kinematic properties as \znunu + jets when the photon is ingored but 
different acceptance. ~\cite{PAS-SUS-08-002,Bern:2011pa}  A \mj control
sample is used to estimated the all remaining background including the 
dominant \wj and \ttbar process.

The following sections describe the estimation method and contol selection.

\subsection{Overview of the method\label{sec:background-method}}

Consider a bin in  \scalht, \njet, \nb, the method predicts the number 
of expected background processes in a signal region ($\npre^{\rm  signal}$) 
by translating from the observed data yield in a control region 
($\nobs^{\rm  control}$) through the use of a {\it translation factor} 
(TF) constructed from the ratio of MC signal and control yields ie:

\begin{equation}
  \label{equ:pred-method}
  \npre^{\rm signal} = \underbrace{\frac{N_{\rm MC}^{\rm
      signal}}{N_{\rm MC}^{\rm
      control}}}_\text{translation factor}\! \times \; \nobs^{\rm
    control}   
\end{equation}

The sum of expected yields from all MC samples, obtained for the
relevant control sample selection, enter the denominator of each
transfer factor:

\begin{equation}
  \label{equ:ratio-denom}
  N_{\rm MC}^{\rm control} = N_{\rm W} + N_{\ttbar} + N_{\znunu} +
N_{\rm DY} + N_{\gamma} + N_{\rm top} + N_{\rm di-boson}
\end{equation}

%When constructing the transfer factors, the MC expectations for the
%following SM processes are considered: W + jets ($N_{\rm W}$), \ttbar
%+ jets ($N_{\ttbar}$), \znunu\ + jets ($N_{\znunu}$), DY + jets
%($N_{\mathrm DY}$), \gj ($N_\gamma$), single top + jets
%production via the s, t, and tW-channels ($N_{\rm top}$), and WW +
%jets, WZ + jets, and ZZ + jets ($N_{\rm di-boson}$). Details on the MC
%samples used are given in Sec.~\ref{sec:mc-samples}. All MC samples
%are normalised to the intergrated luminosity of the appopriate data
%sample.
%
%While ``na\"ive'' predictions can be made using
%Equ.~\ref{equ:pred-method}, the fitting prcedure that provides the
%final result is defined formally by the likelihood model described in
%Sec.~\ref{sec:statistics}. In summary, the observation in each bin
%(defined in terms of the variables \njet, \nb, and \scalht) of the
%signal sample is modelled as Poisson-distributed about the sum of a SM
%expectation (and a potential signal contribution). The components of
%this SM expectation are related to the expected yields in the control
%samples via transfer factors derived from simulation, as described
%in Sec.~\ref{sec:background-method}. The observations in each bin
%(again defined by \njet, \nb, and \scalht) of the control samples are
%similarly modelled as Poisson-distributed about the expectated yields
%for each control sample. In this way, for a given bin, the observed
%yields in the signal and control samples are all connected via the
%transfer factors derived from simulation.

As described in [REF], depending on the b-tag category, one or both
control samples are used to predict the backgrounds in the signal region.
For the  b-jet multiplicity bins $n_b = 0$ and $n_b = 1$, the \mg and 
\gj control samples are used to predict to total background. The \gj control
sample is used to predict the \znunu + jets background and the expected yield
obtained from the \znunu sample enters the numerator of each transfer
factor:

\begin{equation}
  \label{equ:ratio-numer-gj}
  N_{\rm MC}^{\rm signal}(\scalht,\njet,0 \leq \nb \leq 1) = N_{\znunu}
\end{equation}

for the same \bjet categories, The \mj control sample is used to predict 
the remaining SM background processes, namely the W + jets, \ttbar + jets,
Drell-Yan, di-boson and single top backgrounds, and the total expected yield
from these processes enter the The numerator of each transfer factor:

\begin{equation}
  \label{equ:ratio-numer-mj}
  N_{\rm MC}^{\rm signal}(\scalht,\njet,\nb \leq 1) = N_{\rm W} +
  N_{\ttbar} + N_{\rm DY} + N_{\rm top} + N_{\rm di-boson}
\end{equation}

only the \mj control sample is used to predict the background.
for the b-tag multiplicty bin $n_b = 2$,  The \gj control sample is not 
used as the yields in this data control sample is expected to be low
due to the requirement of at least two b jets per event. The method of
using a W + jets sample to predict the \znunu\ + jets background has
been used previously~\cite{RA1Paper, RA1Paper2011, RA1Paper2012}.  
Therefore the total predicted expected yield from all processes are used 
enter the numerator of each transfer factor:


\begin{equation}
  \label{equ:ratio-numer-mj}
  N_{\rm MC}^{\rm signal}(\scalht,\njet,\nb = 2) = N_{\rm W} +
  N_{\ttbar} + N_{\rm DY} + N_{\rm top} + N_{\rm di-boson} + N_{\znunu}
\end{equation}


The control samples used to predict the SM backgrounds for each 
event category are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:fit-plots}.


\begin{table}[ht!]

    background for each event category. }

%The selection criteria for the three control samples closely resemble
%those for the signal region, differing mainly through the use of a
%muon, di-muon, or photon {\it tag} (that is ignored in the calculation
%of jet-based kinematic variables such as \scalht, \mht, \alphat, \etc)
%and some minimal additional kinematic requirements (\eg invariant or
%transerve mass windows) to obtain W, Z, and \ttbar-enriched event
%samples. The same selection criteria are designed to suppress signal
%contamination in the control samples so that unbiased data-driven
%estimates for the SM backgrounds in the signal region can be
%made. Hence, we refer to these samples as {\it control} samples
%although in the final simultaneous fit, any potential signal
%contamination is properly taken into account.
%
%The control sample definitions and binning scheme are chosen so that
%the reliance on simulation to extrapolate correctly from a control
%region to the signal region is minimised. Many systematic effects are
%expected to cancel largely in the transfer factor. However, a
%systematic uncertainty is assigned to each transfer factor to account
%for theoretical uncertainties and effects such as the mismodelling of
%kinematics (\eg acceptances) and instrumental effects (\eg
%reconstruction efficiencies), as described in
%Sec.~\ref{sec:bkgd-syst}.
%
%%Kinematic cuts are applied to enrich as much as possible the \wj,
%%\ttbar, and \znunu components in the muon and di-muon control
%%samples. The definition of the samples are geared towards efficiency
%%rather than purity (even so, the purities are at the level $>$90\%)
%%and any contamination from "backgrounds" (\eg \ttbar in the case of
%%the \mmj sample) are simply incorporated into the transfer
%%factors. Alternatively, a zero b-jet requirement can be applied to the
%%\mmj sample to obtain a higher purity of Z$\rightarrow\mu\mu$ + jets
%%events (\ie, with reduced contamination from \ttbar), which can then
%%be used to give an expectation for the \znunu + jets background for
%%all b-jet categories in the signal region.
%
%\subsection{Definition of the control samples\label{sec:def-control-samples}}
%
%\subsubsection{The \texorpdfstring{\mj}{muon plus jets} control sample}
%
%Events from the \wj and \ttbar processes are found in the hadronic
%signal sample due to unidentified leptons (either out of acceptance or
%not reconstructed) and hadronic tau decays originating from
%high-p$_{T}$ W bosons. An estimate of these background processes is
%obtained through the use of a \mj sample. The selection criteria for
%this sample are chosen to identify W bosons decaying to a muon and a
%neutrino in the phase-space of the signal. The muon is not considered
%in the calculation of event-level variables such as \scalht, \mht and
%\alphat. All cuts on such jet-based quantities are consistent with
%those applied in the hadronic search region and the same \njet, \nb,
%and \scalht binning is used. The only exception is that no \alphat
%requirement is made, as motivated by the discussion in
%Sec.~\ref{sec:larger}. In order to select events containing W bosons,
%exactly one tight isolated muon within an acceptance of \PT $>$ 30
%\gev and $|\eta| <$ 2.1 is required (due to the trigger), and the
%transverse mass of the W candidate must satisfy $30 < \mt(\mu,\pfmet)
%< 125\gev$ (to suppress QCD multijet and potential signal
%events). Events are vetoed if $\Delta R(\mu,\textrm{jet}_i) < 0.5$
%running over all jets $i$. The single isolated track veto, described
%in Sections~\ref{sec:reconstruction} and~\ref{sec:vetoes}, is also
%applied, which considers all single isolated tracks in the event
%except that associated with the identified, isolated muon. Finally,
%the cleaning cut $\mht/\pfmet$ is also applied, as done in the signal
%region, where the \pfmet is adjusted to account for the transverse
%momentum of the identified, isolated muon.
%
%% Events are vetoed if either of the following conditions are met:
%% $\Delta R(\mu,\textrm{jet}_i) < 0.5$, running over all jets $i$; or
%% a second muon candidate exists that is either loose, non-isolated or
%% outside acceptance and the two muons have an invariant mass that
%% satisfies $m_{Z} - 25 < M_{\mu_1\mu_2} < m_{Z} + 25$ (to suppress
%% $Z\rightarrow\mu\mu$).
%
%\subsubsection{The \texorpdfstring{\mmj}{di-muon plus jets} control sample}
%
%The \znunu\ + jets process forms an irreducible background and can be
%estimated using the \zmumu + jets process, which has similar kinematic
%properties but a different acceptance and a smaller branching ratio. A
%background estimate is obtained through the use of a \mmj sample. Most
%of the selection criteria are identical to those for the \mj sample,
%but the few that differ are tuned to identify Z bosons decaying to two
%muons in the kinematic phase space of the signal region. The muons are
%not considered in the calculation of event-level variables such as
%\scalht, \mht and \alphat. All cuts on such jet-based quantities are
%consistent with those applied in the hadronic search region and the
%same \njet, \nb, and \scalht binning is used. The only exception is
%that no \alphat requirement is made, as motivated by the discussion in
%Sec.~\ref{sec:larger}. In order to select an event sample containing Z
%bosons, exactly two tight isolated muons within an acceptance of $\Pt
%> 30\gev$ and $|\eta| < 2.1$ are required (due to the trigger). The
%invariant mass of the two muons must satisfy $m_{Z} - 25 <
%M_{\mu_1\mu_2} < m_{Z} + 25$. Events are vetoed if $\Delta
%R(\mu_{i},\textrm{jet}_j) < 0.5$ is satisfied, running over all muons
%$i$ and all jets $j$. The single isolated track veto, described in
%Sections~\ref{sec:reconstruction} and~\ref{sec:vetoes}, is also
%applied, considering all single isolated tracks in the event except
%those associated with the two identified, isolated muons. Finally, the
%cleaning cut $\mht/\pfmet$ is also applied, as done in the signal
%region, where the \pfmet is adjusted to account for the transverse
%momenta of the two identified, isolated muons. The \mmj sample can be
%used to make predictions in all the \scalht bins, providing coverage
%at low \scalht where the \gj sample cannot.
%
%\subsubsection{The \texorpdfstring{\gj}{photon plus jets} control sample}
%
%The \znunu\ + jets process can also be estimated using the \gj
%process, which has a larger cross section and kinematic properties
%similar to those of \znunu\ events when the photon is
%ignored~\cite{PAS-SUS-08-002,Bern:2011pa}. The \gj sample is defined
%by requiring exactly one photon satisfying tight isolation criteria
%and within an acceptance of $\pt > 165\gev$ and $|\eta| <
%1.45$. Furthermore, events are vetoed if $\Delta
%R(\gamma,\textrm{jet}_j) < 1.0$ is satisfied, running over all jets
%$j$. As for the muon-based samples, the photon is not considered in
%the calculation of event-level variables such as \scalht, \mht and
%\alphat. All cuts on jet-based quantities are consistent with those
%applied in the hadronic search region, and the same \HT binning is
%used. Given that the photon is ignored, the \gj sample can only be
%used for the region $\scalht > 375\gev$ due to the photon acceptance
%of $\pt > 165\gev$ (enforced by the trigger) and the requirement
%$\alphat > 0.55$.
%
%\subsection{Increasing the acceptance of the muon control samples\label{sec:larger}}
%
%As described in Sec.~\ref{sec:def-control-samples} above, the
%selection criteria of the three control samples are defined such that
%the background composition and event kinematics of the three control
%samples mirror as closely as possible those for the signal
%region. This is done in order to minimise the reliance on the
%simulation to model correctly the backgrounds and event kinematics in
%the control and signal samples.
%
%However, in the case of the \mj and \mmj samples, no requirement is
%made on \alphat in the selection criteria of the samples. This is made
%possible by the remaining kinematic selection criteria, which are
%sufficiently selective to ensure that the muon samples remain rich in
%events from the \wj, \ttbar and \zmumu processes with negligible
%contamination from QCD multijet events. These selection criteria
%include, for example, requiring exactly one or two tight isolated
%muon(s), and imposing acceptance windows on the invariant mass of the
%di-muon sytem or the transverse mass of the muon-\pfmet system, as
%described above. 
%%The absence of QCD multijet events is demonstrated by the control
%%distributions shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:est-control-samples} below. 
%Thus, the acceptance of the two muon control samples can be
%significantly increased, which simultaneously improves their
%predictive power and further reduces the effect of any potential
%signal contamination.  In the case of the \gj sample (used only for
%the region $\scalht > 375\gev$), the requirement $\alphat > 0.55$ is
%still necessary to suppress contamination from QCD multijet events,
%even after the substantial photon \pt cut in the offline selection.
%
%The extrapolation in the variable \alphat is tested through a
%dedicated set of closure tests, described in Sec.~\ref{sec:bkgd-syst},
%which demonstrate that the different \alphat requirements for the \mj
%and \mmj control samples and signal region have no significant
%systematic bias on the prediction. That the \alphat variable
%introduces no acceptance bias for processes with genuine \met is due
%to the accurate modelling by the CMS simulation of such processes,
%namely W + jets, \ttbar, and \znunu\ + jets. Background estimates for
%these processes are provided by the \mj and \mmj samples, as
%identified at the beginning of this Section. Importantly, the same
%cannot be said for QCD multijet events, as in this case the only
%events that survive the \alphat cut are pathological cases in which a
%jet is severely mismeasured or even lost due to detector
%inefficiencies. Such effects certainly do change the event kinematics
%and, in these cases, an \alphat cut will selectively choose events
%with particular kinematic features and topologies. For these
%pathological cases, one cannot rely on MC to model correctly the
%behaviour and therefore the \alphat acceptance. This is a crucial
%distinction to be made between QCD multijet events and processes with
%significant genuine \met. The assumption is that processes with
%genuine \met are selected by the \alphat variable based on the
%escaping invisible particle(s) rather than any pathological effects.
%
%%\subsection{Distributions from the data control samples\label{sec:est-control-samples}}
%%
%%Distributions of key variables for the \mj, \mmj, and \gj samples are
%%shown in below in Figs.~\ref{fig:mu-distr}, \ref{fig:mumu-distr},
%%and~\ref{fig:phot-distr}, respectively. The first two figures show
%%the (leading) muon \pt and isolation distributions, along with the
%%leading jet \pt, \scalht, \mht and \alphat distributions. For the \gj
%%sample, the photon \pt distribution is%and isolation distributions are
%%shown in place of the corresponding muon distribution.%s.
%%No requirement is made on the number of b-jets per event. In general,
%%the agreement between data and simulation is good, giving confidence
%%that the samples are well understood. The MC distributions highlight
%%the composition of each sample. The contribution from QCD multijet
%%events is expected to be negligible.
%%
%%Figure~\ref{fig:jet-bjet} shows the jet and b-jet multiplicity
%%distributions for the \mj, \mmj, and \gj control samples, as defined
%%in Sec.~\ref{sec:def-control-samples} and following the requirement
%%$\scalht > 375\gev$. An accurate modelling of the jet multiplicity in
%%data is achieved for all samples. The b-jet distributions demonstrate
%%the changing background composition as a function of the number of
%%b-jets. For the \mj and \mmj samples, the requirement of zero b-jets
%%results in sub-samples that are rich in W and Z bosons, respectively,
%%with little contamination from \ttbar. The \ttbar background becomes
%%dominant in the \mj sample when exactly one b-jet is required. The
%%requirement of up to two b-tags per event significantly suppresses all
%%processes except for \ttbar production. Requiring at least three
%%b-tags also suppresses \ttbar production. In the case of the \mmj
%%sample, some contamination from \ttbar is observed for $\nb =
%%1$. Requiring more than one b-jet significantly suppresses the yields
%%in both the \mmj and \gj samples.

%%\subsection{Transfer factors and ``na\"ive'' predictions\label{sec:est-control-samples}}
%%
%%Appendix~\ref{app:tf} contains tables summarising the observed and
%%expected yields from data and simulation, respectively, in the bins of
%%the three control samples. Also listed are the expectations from
%%simulation for the various background contributions in the signal
%%region, along with the corresponding transfer factors. The yields
%%are binned in \scalht, jet multiplicity and number of b-jets per
%%event. The errors associated with the transfer factors reflect the
%%uncertainty due to the finite size of the MC samples used to determine
%%the factors. Any trigger inefficiency is also factored into the
%%transfer factors (\ie, the trigger is effectively emulated and
%%yields from the MC samples are corrected to account for any
%%inefficiency). Also, all MC expectations are corrected to account for
%%any discrepancies between data and MC for the efficiency and mistag
%%rate of the b-tagging algorithm used, as described further in
%%Sec.~\ref{sec:btag-eff-correction}. However, no systematic
%%uncertainties on the transfer factors are quoted in the tables.
%%
%%The same tables also list ``na\"ive'' predicted yields obtained from
%%each control sample for individual SM backgrounds in the signal region
%%(\eg, W + jets and \ttbar from the \mj sample, and \znunu + jets from
%%the \mmj and \gj samples). These predictions are given for
%%illustrative purposes only. For the analysis result, the predictions
%%for the total SM background are determined by a fit to the yields in
%%the signal region and all three control samples, as described in
%%Sec.~\ref{sec:statistics}. In addition to observed yields, the fit
%%takes as input the transfer factors with their associated
%%statistical and systematic uncertainties. 
%%
%%Illustrative predictions for the total SM background can be made for
%%each bin in the signal region, by combining the individual
%%predictions. One such combination can be made by using the individual
%%predictions from the \mj and \mmj samples (or, alternatively, the
%%predictions from the \mj and \gj samples), the result of which can be
%%compared with the observed yields in the bins of the signal
%%region. Predictions in this way are made for bins of the three
%%exclusive b-tag categories requiring exactly zero and one b-tags per
%%event. When requiring at least two b-tagged jets per event, only the
%%\mj sample has sufficiently large yields to predict accurately the
%%total SM background. The errors on the total SM predictions reflect
%%statistical uncertainties only. It is again noted that these
%%``na\"ive'' predictions are for illustration only, with the final SM
%%expectations for all signal region bins given by the simultaneous fit
%%to yields in all data samples. Table~\ref{tab:tf-summary} summarises
%%the contents of the various sections in the Appendix that list tables
%%containing observed yields, MC expectations, transfer factors, and
%%``na\"ive'' predictions for individual and total SM backgrounds.
