\subsection{The Standard Model\label{sec:SM}}
SM,Higgs

Particle physics concerns itself with the study of particles and fields. 
Our current knowledge of their charactericts and interactions are formalized
the quantum field theory called the Standard Model.  I 
through three symmetries: The color charge symmetry of Quantum Chromo 
Dynamics (QCD) represented in SU(3), the flavor symemmetry of Quantum 
Flavor Dynamics (QFD) represented in SU(2) and the electric charge symmetry of Quantum 
Electro Dynamics represented in U(1). Together, SU(3)XSU(2)XU(1) 
represent the field theory.
