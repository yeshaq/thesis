\section{Statistical framework}
\label{sec:statistics}
The observations in the hadronic and control regions described in 
chapter~\ref{sec:backgrounds} are interpreted through a likelihood model 
constructed in the following section. The method to set a limit on the 
cross-section of signal models is described in section~\ref{sec:cls}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Likelihood model\label{likelihood}}

\subsubsection{Hadronic sample}
\label{sec:hadronicLikelihood}

For a given \njet and \nb category, 
let $N$ be the number of bins of \HT. Let $n^i$ represent 
the number of events observed satisfying all selection requirements 
in each \HT bin $i$.  The likelihood of the observerations can be written
as:
\begin{equation}
L_{hadronic}=\prod_i \mathrm{Pois}(n^i |\, b^i + s^i)
\label{eq:hadronicLikelihood}
\end{equation}

where $b^i$ represents the expected Standard Model background in bin
$i$, $s^i$ represents the expected number of signal events in bin $i$,
and $\mathrm{Pois}$ represents the Poisson distribution:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Pois}\left(k;\lambda\right)= \frac{\lambda^k \exp^{\left(-\lambda\right)}}{k!}
\label{eq:poisson}
\end{equation}

Due to the choice in \alphat and \scalht thresholds, the contribution 
from QCD events is expected to be negligible, Sec.~\ref{sec:alphat}. Therfore,
it is assumed that $b^i\equiv \ewk^i$ where $\ewk^i$ is the expected 
yield of electroweak events in bin $i$.

%\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\HT}{HT} evolution models}
%\label{sec:htEvolutionModel}
%
%The hypothesis that for a process $p$ the $\alt$ ratio falls
%exponentially in \HT can be written this way:
%
%\begin{equation}
%R_{\alt}(\HT) = A e^{-k \HT}
%\end{equation}
%
%where $A$ and $k$ are parameters whose values will be determined.  Let
%$m_i$ represent the number of events observed with $\alt \le 0.55$ in
%each \HT bin $i$, and let \meanHt{i} represent the mean \HT of such
%events.  The expected background from the process is written thus:
%
%\begin{equation}
%b_{p}^{i} = \int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}}\! \frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\mathrm{d}\HT}
%R_{\alt}\, \mathrm{d}\HT \quad , 
%\end{equation}
%
%where $\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\mathrm{d}\HT}$ is the distribution of \HT
%for events with $\alt \le 0.55$, $x_i$ is the lower edge of the
%bin, and $x_{i+1}$ is the upper edge of the bin ($\infty$ for the
%final bin).  It is assumed that
%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\mathrm{d}\HT}(x) = \sum_i
%m^{i}\delta(x-\meanHt{i}) \quad , 
%\end{equation}
%
%\ie within a bin the whole distribution occurs at the mean value of
%\HT in that bin. Then:
%
%\begin{equation}
%b_{p}^{i} = \int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}}\! m^{i}\delta(x-\meanHt{i}) Ae^{-kx}\, \mathrm{d}x = m^{i} Ae^{-k \meanHt{i}} \quad .
%\label{eq:biDiracExp}
%\end{equation}
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Electroweak control samples\label{sec:ewk}}

The electroweak background can be split into its reducible and 
irreducible backgrounds, i.e. $\ewk^i =  \zInv{i} + ttW^{i}$.
$\zInv{i}$ represents the contribution from \znunu + jets
events in \HT bin $i$ of the hadronically selected sample, 
and the variable $ttW^{i}$ represents the contribution from 
all other backgrounds in \HT bin $i$ of the hadronically 
selected sample.  
%Let \fZinv{i} represent the fraction of 
%\znunu + jets events in the total background $\ewk^{i}$. 
%It is a floating parameter limited between zero and one.
%Each contribution to the total electroweak re-written background can be 
%rewritten asLet:
%
%\begin{equation}
%  \zInv{i} \equiv \fZinv{i} \times \ewk^i 
%  \label{eq:ZinvEwk}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%  ttW^{i} \equiv (1-\fZinv{i})\times \ewk^i
%  \label{eq:ttWEwk}
%\end{equation}
%
%The variable $\zInv{i}$ thus represents the expected number of \znunu
%events in \HT bin $i$ of the hadronically selected sample, and the
%variable $ttW^i$ represents the expected number of events from SM
%$W$-boson production (including top quark decays) ing \HT bin $i$ of
%the hadronically selected sample.

In each bin $i$ of \HT, there are two measurements: $n_{ph}^i$,
$n_{\mu}^i$, representing the event counts in the photon and single-muon.  
Each of these measurements has a corresponding yield in simulated 
data: $MC_{ph}^i$, $MC_{\mu}^i$.  The simulation also 
gives expected amounts of $\zInv{}$ and $t\bar{t}+W$ in 
the hadronically-selected sample: $MC_{\zInv{}}^i$ and 
$MC_{t\bar{t}+W}^i$.  After defining

\begin{equation}
r_{ph}^i = \frac{MC_{ph}^i}{MC_{\zInv{}}^i};\, r_{\mu}^i =
\frac{MC_{\mu}^i}{MC_{t\bar{t}+W}^i}\quad ,
\end{equation}

these likelihood functions are used:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:photonLikelihood}
L_{ph}= \prod_i \mathrm{Pois}(n_{ph}^i |\, \rho_{phZ}^j \cdot
r_{ph}^{i} \cdot \zInv{i})
\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:mumuLikelihood}
%L_{\mu\mu}=\prod_i \mathrm{Pois}(n_{\mu\mu}^i |\, \rho_{\mu\mu Z}^j
%\cdot r_{\mu\mu}^{i} \cdot \zInv{i})
%\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muonLikelihood}
L_{\mu}=\prod_i \mathrm{Pois}(n_{\mu}^i |\, \rho_{\mu W}^j \cdot
r_{\mu}^{i} \cdot ttW^{i} + s_{\mu}^i)\quad .
\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:photonLikelihood} can be used to estimate the maximum
likelihood value for $\zInv{i}$ (the expectation for the \znunu\ +
jets background in the hadronic signal region) given the observations
$n_{ph}^i$ in the photon control sample and the ratios $r_{ph}^i$. A
similar construction is used when estimating $ttW^{i}$ from the single 
muon control sample (Equ.~\ref{eq:muonLikelihood}). The measurements in 
each of the control samples and the hadronic search region, along with 
the ratios $r_{ph}^{i}$ and $r_{\mu}^{i}$, are all considered
simultaneously through the relationship $\ewk^i =  \zInv{i} + ttW^{i}$.
The ratios $r_{ph}^{i}$ and $r_{\mu}^{i}$ are simply 
the inverse of the translation factor (1/TF) defined in 
Equ.~\ref{equ:pred-method} (Sec.~\ref{sec:background-method}). More 
specifically, $MC_{ph}^i$ and $MC_{\mu}^i$ are the yields obtained from MC
after applying the selection criteria for the photon and single muon samples, 
as defined by Equ.~\ref{equ:ratio-denom} (Sec.~\ref{sec:background-method}). 
The variables $MC_{t\bar{t}+W}^i$ and $MC_{\zInv{}}^i$ are defined by 
Equs.~\ref{equ:ratio-numer-gj} and~\ref{equ:ratio-numer-mj} 
(Sec.~\ref{sec:background-method}), respectively.

The parameters $\rho_{phZ}^j$ and $\rho_{\mu
  W}^j$ represent ``correction factors'' that accommodate the
systematic uncertainties associated with the control-sample-based
background constraints.  The quantities $\sigma_{phZ}^j$
and $\sigma_{\mu W}^j$ represent the relative
systematic uncertainties for the control sample constraints, taken
into account with the following terms:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ewkSyst}
L_{\rm EWK\, syst.}=\prod_j \mathrm{Logn}( 1.0 |\,\rho_{\mu W}^j,
\sigma_{\mu W}^j)\times \mathrm{Logn}( 1.0 |\,\rho_{ph Z}^j,
\sigma_{phZ}^j) \quad ,
\end{equation}

where Logn is the log-normal
distribution~\cite{cousins-log-normal}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:log-normal}
\mathrm{Logn}(x |\,\mu,\sigma_{\mathrm{rel.}}) =
\frac{1}{x\sqrt{2\pi}\ln{k}}\exp{\left(-\frac{\ln^2{\left(\frac{x}{\mu}\right)}}{2\ln^2{k}}\right)};\quad
k=1+\sigma_{\mathrm rel.}\quad. 
\end{equation}

One systematic parameter is assinged per \HT bin.

\newcommand{\rpi}{\ensuremath{r_{\mu}^{\prime\ i}}\xspace}

For the categories where $\nb=2$, the single muon sample is used to constrain the
total EWK background thus:

\begin{equation}
\rpi \equiv \frac{MC_{\mu}^i}{MC_{t\bar{t}+W+\zInv{}}^i}\quad ;
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muonLikelihoodTotalEwk}
L_{\mu}=\prod_i \mathrm{Pois}(n_{\mu}^i |\, \rho_{\mu W}^j \cdot
\rpi \cdot \ewk^{i} + s_{\mu}^i)\quad .
\end{equation}

The photon likelihood is dropped and spliting $\ewk^i$ is no longer
nescessary thus $\zInv{i}$ and $ttW^{i}$ can be dropped. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Contributions from signal}
\label{sec:signalContrib}

Let $x$ represent the cross section for a particular signal model, and
let $l$ represent the recorded luminosity.  Let $\epsilon^{i}_{had}$ 
be the analysis efficiency as simulated for the model in \HT bin $i$ 
of the hadronic sample.  Let $\delta$ represent the relative uncertainty on
the signal yield, assumed to be fully correlated among the bins, and
let $\rho_{sig}$ represent the ``correction factor'' to the signal
yield which accommodates this uncertainty.  Let $f$ represent an
unknown multiplicative factor on the signal cross section, for which
an allowed interval shall be determined.

Then the expected hadronic signal yield $s^i$ from
Equation~\ref{eq:hadronicLikelihood} is written as $s^i \equiv
f\rho_{sig} xl\epsilon_{had}^i$. The systematic uncertainty on
the signal efficiency is included via an additional term in the
likelihood:

\begin{equation}
L_{sig}=\mathrm{Logn}(1.0 |\,\rho_{sig}, \delta) \quad .
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Total likelihood}
\label{sec:totalLikelihood}

The likelihood function for a given selection $k$ is the product of
the terms described in the previous sections:

\begin{equation}
L^k = L_{hadronic}^k \times L_{\mu}^k \times L_{ph}^k \times
L_{\rm EWK\, syst.}^k \quad .
\end{equation}

A final reparametrization of the variables $\zInv{}$ and $ttW$ is made
by indroducing, $f_{\rm Zinv}$, the fraction of \znunu + jets events in the total
electroweak background:

\begin{equation}
  \zInv{i} \equiv \fZinv{i} \times \ewk^i 
  \label{eq:ZinvEwk}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  ttW^{i} \equiv (1-\fZinv{i})\times \ewk^i
  \label{eq:ttWEwk}
\end{equation}


This reparametrization allows representing the fit results with the floating
parameters $\ewk^{i}$ which is convenient for comparison to the observed data
in the hadronic region. 

In a category with 8 \HT bins and two control samples, there are 
32 nuisance parameters: $\{\ewk^{i}\}_{i=0}^{7}$, $\{\fZinv{i}\}_{i=0}^{7}$, $\{\rho_{phZ}\}_{i=0}^{7}$,
$\{\rho_{muZ}\}_{i=0}^{7}$. In the $\nb = 2$ categories there are 
18 nuisance parameters: $\{\ewk^{i}\}_{i=0}^{7}$, $\{\fZinv{i}\}_{i=0}^{7}$, 
$\{\rho_{muZ}\}_{i=0}^{7}$.  When considering signal, 
there is also the parameter $\rho_{sig}$; when multiple categories 
are fit simultaneously, the total likelihood is

\begin{equation}
L = L_{sig}\times \prod_k L_{hadronic}^k
\times L_{\mu}^k \times L_{ph}^k \times L_{\rm EWK\, syst.}^k \quad .
\end{equation}
