\section{Limits on SMS production cross sections\label{sec:interpretation}}

Upper limits on the production cross section of the two simplified 
SUSY models described in chapter~\ref{sec:signal} are discussed in this
chapter. 


\subsection{Limit setting procedure\label{sec:cls}}

The following has been formulated in~\cite{LairdThesis} and is summarized 
here for completeness. 
Consider the likelihood ratio~\cite{Cowan:2010js}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:PLR}
\lambda(\mu) = \frac{ L(\mu,
\hat{\hat{\vec{\theta}}}) } {L(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\vec{\theta}}) } \;.
\end{equation}

Where $\hat{\hat{\vec{\theta}}}$ in the numerator denotes the
value of $\vec{\theta}$, the set of nuisance parameters in the likelihood,
that maximizes $L$ for the specified $\mu$.
The denominator is the maximized likelihood function, i.e., $\hat{\mu}$
and $\hat{\vec{\theta}}$ are their ML estimators. In the context of this
analysis $\mu \equiv f$ where $f$ is the signal strength as defined 
in section~\ref{sec:signalContrib}.  One can define the profile
likelihood ratio test statistic as~\cite{Cowan:2010js}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qmu}
q_{\mu} =
\left\{ \! \! \begin{array}{ll}
               - 2 \ln \lambda(\mu)  & \hat{\mu} \le \mu  \;, \\*[0.2 cm]
               0 & \hat{\mu} > \mu \;,
              \end{array}
       \right.
\end{equation}

To test a specific signal model, one approach would be to perform many 
pseudo-experiments under the two separate hypotheses: background-only 
(i.e. $\mu=0$) and background with signal (i.e. $\mu=1$). $CL_{b}$ and 
$CL_{s+b}$~\cite{read,Junk} are defined as 1 - the quantile of $q_{\mu(obs)}$ in each of 
these distributions, where $q_{\mu(obs)}$ is the test statistic evaluated 
with the observed data. Figure~\ref{fig:hybrid_plot} illustrates two example distributions of
the test statistic under each hypothesis.  $CL_{s}$ is then defined as $CL_{s} \equiv CL_{s+b}/CL_{b}$, 
and a value $CL_{s} < 0.05$ excludes the signal hypothesis at 95\% confidence level. 

Another approach is to instead calculate the upper limit on the signal 
cross section by determining $f$ at $CL_{s} = 0.05$.  This approach samples 
CLs at varying signal strengths and the upper limit is 
determined through interpolation. If the upper limit on the cross section 
is lower than the theoretical cross section, the signal model is excluded.

        The black line represents the value of the $q_{\mu}$ on the tested data. The shaded areas represent 
        $1-CL_{b}$ (red) and $CL_{s+b}$ (blue).  From~\cite{Moneta:1289965}}.

\subsection{Upper limits on SMS models}

For each mass-pair in a given model, the upper limit is calculated as described in 
section~\ref{sec:cls} using the likelihood constructed in section~\ref{sec:likelihood}
by considering the relevant categories listed in table~\ref{tab:simplified-models}.

\subsubsection{Upper limits on T2cc}
The color scale in figure~\ref{fig:upperLimits-t2cc} shows the observed upper 
limit at 95\% confidence level for each sparticle mass-pair bin in the SMS 
model where a stop particle decays to a charm quark and a neutralino (\texttt{T2cc}). 
The mass-pair bins left of the thick black curve have a calculated cross 
section upper limit below the theoretical production cross section, 
i.e. $\frac{\sigma_{\texttt{obs. upper limit}}}{\sigma_{\texttt{theory}}} < 1$, and
are therefore excluded. The thinner black lines represent exclusion regions obtained by
comparing the calculated upper limit with the theoretical cross section shifted up down 
and by its theoretical uncertainty i.e. 
$\frac{\sigma_{\texttt{obs. upper limit}}}{\sigma_{\texttt{theory} \pm \texttt{uncertainty}}} < 1$.
The dashed purple lines indicate the median (thick line) $\pm 1 \sigma$ 
(thin lines) expected exclusion regions. The $\pm 1 \sigma$ expected exclusion 
regions are not obtained by varying the theoretical cross section but rather 
by comparing the calculated expected upper limit $\pm 1 \sigma$ uncertainty
with the nominal cross section. The observed upper limit curve lies within
$+1 \sigma$ expected curve. For comparison, figure~\ref{fig:atlas} shows similar
exclusion limits obtained by the ATLAS collaboration~\cite{Aad:2008zzm} for the same 
model.

    (b) shows exclusion region in the same model obtained by the ATLAS collaboration, from~\cite{Aad:2014nra}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Upper limits on T2tt}

The color scale in figure~\ref{fig:upperLimits-t2tt} shows the observed upper 
limit at 95\% confidence level for each sparticle mass-pair bin in the SMS 
model where a stop particle decays to a top quark and a neutralino (\texttt{T2tt}). 
The definitions of the excluded regions remain the same as \texttt{t2cc}.
The observed upper limit disagrees with the expected by more than $2\sigma$.
It is instructive to re-examine the \scalht bins which show the highest excesses 
when considering a SM-only hypotheses. To this intent, figure~\ref{fig:sigVsCat} of 
chapter~\ref{sec:results} is re-plotted in figure~\ref{fig:sigVsCat2} to 
isolate the categories used in interpreting \texttt{T2tt}. In the \njethigh 
and $\nb = 2$ category, \scalht bins $575-675$ and $675-775\GeV$ show excesses of 
$\sim\!\!2.5\sigma$ and $\sim\!\!1.5\sigma$ respectively. In the \njethigh and 
$\nb = 1$ category, the lowest two \scalht bins are $\sim\!\!1.5\sigma$ 
from expectation. More generally, the categories used to interpret \texttt{T2tt} can be
characterized by mild excesses in the lowest \scalht bins and with
a more pronounced excess in \scalht = $575~\GeV-675~\GeV$ in \njethigh 
and $\nb = 2$ category.

The discrepancy in the observed and expected 
limit is better understood with a closer study of the mass-pair
bin ($m_{\st} = 400\GeV$, $m_{\text{LSP}} = 0\GeV$), which is 
expected to be excluded but it is not by the observed data. 
It is useful to gauge the signal significance, defined here as the signal 
yield divided by $\sqrt{b+(.1b)^2}$ where $b$ is the SM expectation 
as determined by a simultaneous fit to all under under the SM background 
hypothesis. Figure~\ref{fig:t2tt-sig-400_100} plots the signal significance in bins of 
\scalht and shows that most of the significance is expected in the 
lower \scalht bins in both categories. Furthermore, 
figure~\ref{fig:t2tt-best-fit-400_100} shows the \scalht-binned 
observed data yields and expectations for the hadronic sample, as determined 
by a simultaneous fit to all data samples under a signal+background 
hypothesis. The signal under consideration remains $m_{\st} = 400\GeV$ and 
$m_{\text{LSP}} = 100\GeV$. The fit is performed simultaneously across 
both event categories. The plots give the indication that while the excesses 
in the low \scalht bins are mild, they are enough to accommodate a signal-like
excess. Finally, a profile likelihood ratio scan is performed 
as a function of signal strength to visualize the signal strength value 
best fitting the data and the upper limit on that signal strength
at 95\% confidence level. 
%A similar disagreement between observed and expected
%exclusions was observed in the latest published

\subsection{Summary}

Years of effort from thousands of people around the world
has brought the LHC and CMS past trough the phases of design, construction,
and commission, to a successful physics run in 2012. Through a dedicated
team of engineers and physicists, CMS recorded more than 20$\fbinv$ of data and 
which in the process allowed the confirmation of the existence of the Higgs boson. 
The spectacular efficiency of the detector also allowed
searches beyond the Standard Model; this work presents such a search
in events with jets and missing transverse energy. By using the variable $\alphat$
the analysis effectively rejects multijet events stemming from QCD and 
mismeasured events. The remaining backgrounds are constrained using
data samples which limit the reliance on Monte Carlo simulations. Though
a slight excess is seen in some event categories, the observations are found 
to agree with the expectations of the Standard Model. The results are interpreted
in two simplified supersymmetric models: (1) a pair-produced stop decays into a b quark 
jet, W boson, and a neutralino, (2) a pair-produced stop decays into a b quark 
, W boson and neutralino.  In the latter model, exclusion limits comparable to other 
analyses are set.

%%Figure~\ref{fig:limits-sms} shows the upper limit on the cross section
%%at 95\% CL as a function of $m_{\st}$ or $m_{\gl}$ and $m_{\rm LSP}$
%%for various simplified models. The point-to-point fluctuations are due
%%to the finite number of pseudo-experiments used to determine the
%%observed upper limit. The solid thick black line indicates the
%%observed exclusion region assuming NLO+NLL~\cite{Beenakker:1996ch,
%%  susy-nlo-nll} SUSY cross section for squark pair production in the
%%limit of very massive gluinos (or vice versa). The thin black lines
%%represent the observed excluded region when varying the cross section
%%by its theoretical uncertainty. The dashed purple lines indicate the
%%median (thick line) $\pm 1 \sigma$ (thin lines) expected exclusion
%%regions.
%
%%The estimates on mass limits are determined conservatively from the
%%observed exclusion based on the theoretical production cross section
%%minus $1\sigma$ uncertainty.  The most stringent mass limits on
%%pair-produced sparticles are obtained at low LSP masses, while the
%%limits typically weaken for compressed spectra, \ie, points close to
%%the diagonal. In particular, for all of the considered simplified
%%models, there is an LSP mass beyond which no limit can be set. This is
%%illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:t1}, where the most stringent limit on
%%the gluino mass of $950\GeV$ is obtained for low LSP masses. This
%%limit only weakens to $900\GeV$ when the LSP mass reaches
%%$425\GeV$. However, for LSP masses above $450\GeV$, no mass range can
%%be excluded for gluinos decaying to first- or second-generation
%%quarks. Table~\ref{tab:sms} summarises the mass limits obtained from
%%the considered simplified models.

%%Figure~\ref{fig:t2tt-1d} shows the observed upper limit at 95\% CL on
%%the production cross section as a function of the top squark mass
%%($m_{\sTop}$) for the model \texttt{T2tt} when considering different
%%LSP masses in the range 0--150\GeV. No exclusion on possible top
%%squark masses is observed when considering the theoretical production
%%cross section minus $1\sigma$ uncertainty. However, the expected
%%exclusion covers the ranges 300--520\GeV, 320--520\GeV, and
%%420-480\GeV for $m_{\text{LSP}} = 0\GeV$, $m_{\text{LSP}} = 50\GeV$,
%%and $m_{\text{LSP}} = 100\GeV$ respectively. No exclusion is expected
%%for the LSP with a mass greater than 100\GeV.
%%%The expected reach for the T2tt model is summarised
%%%in Table~\ref{tab:sms-reach}. 















%In the \njethigh and $\nb = 2$ category, \scalht bins $575-675$ and 
%$675-775\GeV$ show the highest excesses: $\sim\!\!2.5\sigma$ and 
%$\sim\!\!1.5\sigma$ respectively. In the \njethigh and $\nb = 1$ 
%category, the lowest two \scalht bins show the highest excesses 
%with $\sim\!\!1.5\sigma$. The categories in \texttt{T2tt} can be
%characterized by mild excesses in the lowest \scalht bins and with
%a more pronounced excess in \scalht = $575~\GeV-675~\GeV$ in \njethigh 
%and $\nb = 2$ category.
%
%The descripency the observed and expected limit is further investigated 
%by a closer study of two bins in $(m_{\st},m_{\text{LSP}})$. 
%The first one, $m_{\st} = 400\GeV$ and $m_{\text{LSP}} = 0\GeV$ 
%is excluded by the observed data. It is useful to gauge the signal 
%signifcance, defined here as the signal yield divided by $\sqrt{b+(.1b)^2}$ 
%where $b$ is the SM expectation as determined by a simultaneous 
%fit to all under under the SM background hypothesis. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:t2tt-sig-400} plots the signal significance in bins of 
%\scalht and shows that most of the significance is expected in the 
%lowest \scalht bins in both categories. Furthermore, 
%figure~\ref{fig:t2tt-best-fit-400} shows the \scalht-binned 
%observed data yields and expectations for the hadronic sample, as determined 
%by a simultaneous fit to all data samples under a signal+background 
%hypothesis. The signal under consideration remains $m_{\st} = 400\GeV$ and 
%$m_{\text{LSP}} = 0\GeV$. The fit is performed simultaneously across 
%both event categories. Finally, a profile likelihood ratio scan is performed 
%as a function of signal strength to vizualize the signal strength value 
%best fitting the data and the upper limit on that signal strength
%at 95\% confidence level. 
%To summarize, the excesses are mild enough and the 
%prodcution cross secton for the signal bin $m_{\st} = 400\GeV$ 
%and $m_{\text{LSP}} = 0\GeV$,
