\subsubsection{Muon and photon triggers\label{sec:muon_triggers}}

Events for the muon control sample are recorded with the \verb!HLT_IsoMu24_eta2p1! 
trigger. Figure~\ref{fig:eff-muon} (left) shows the \verb!HLT_IsoMu24_eta2p1! 
trigger efficiency as determined in bins of number of primary vertices 
for muon $\pt >$ 25 \gev and $|\eta| <$ 2.1 by the muon POG~\cite{ref:muon-eff}.
Figure~\ref{fig:eff-muon} (right) shows the distribution of the number 
of vertices in the muon control sample seeded by the \verb!HLT_IsoMu24_eta2p1!. 
The efficiency at the mean number of vertices (nVtx = 13) is taken as flat
trigger efficiency across \njet, \nb and \scalht. This measurement 
agrees well with direct tag and probe measurements in bins of 
\njet, \nb, \scalht done elsewhere. [REF]

Events for the photon control sample are recorded with the
\verb!HLT_Photon150! trigger, which is $\sim100\%$ efficient for
$E_{\rm T}^{\rm photon} > 165\gev$ and $\scalht > 375\gev$, as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:eff-photon}. The efficiency measurement is made
using the \verb!HLT_Photon90! trigger as a reference, and we assume
that the \verb!L1_SingleEG22! seed is fully efficient.
