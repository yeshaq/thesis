This work was supervised by a dissertation committee consisting of Professor 
Garcia-Bellido and Professors Demina and Orr of the Department of Physics and
Astronomy and Professor Frontier of the Department of Chemistry and Professor 
Lin of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The analysis conducted 
is a natural extension of published work I have directly contributed to (listed in 
the Biographical Sketch section), but it utilizes more complex objects than previously done.
All work including plots and tables in the dissertation were produced by the author 
unless otherwise stated. My graduate study was supported by the University of Rochester and through
a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy: DE SC0006535.
