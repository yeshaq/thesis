\section{Physics objects\label{sec:reconstruction}}

The definitions of the physics objects used in this analysis follow
the recommendations of the various Physics Object Groups (POGs).

\subsection{Jets}

Jets are reconstructed by combining information from multiple
sub-detectors using the Particle-Flow (PF) algorithm~\cite{PAS-PFT-09-001} 
and clustered by the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm~\cite{antikt} with
a size parameter of $0.5$. Three levels of jet energy corrections are 
applied; level 1 corrects for overlapping pp collisions 
(pile-up ~\cite{Cacciari2008119,1126-6708-2008-04-005}) in the jet, 
level 2 and 3 correct the jet energy response to be $\eta$ and $\pt$ independent.  
Further residual corrections are applied on data which correct for 
small remaining discripencies in the modelling of the response. The acceptance of
``fake'' jets is supressed by requring that jets pass jet identitifcation at the 
Loose working point~\cite{ref:jet-id}. This requires that the jet is comprised
of more than one particle and that those particles cannot all be neutral hadrons 
(i.e. neutrons) or all neutral particle deposits in the ECAL (i.e. photons).
Additionaly if the jet is reconstructed outside outside the tracker's 
instrumatation, the jet is required to have more than one charged 
constituent, of which not all of them deposit their energy in the ECAL. 
Only jets reconstructed within the calorimeters' barrel and endcap, 
i.e. $|\eta| <$ 3.0, and with transverse momentum $\pt >$ 50\gev  
are considered in the analysis. Jets originating from bottom quarks 
(b-jets) are identified through vertices that are displaced with respect to the primary 
interaction~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-12-001}. The algorithm used to tag b-jets 
is the Combined Secondary Vertex tagger, using the "Medium" working point, 
which is achieved by requiring a cut of $>$0.679 on the algorithm discriminator 
variable and results in a gluon/light-quark quark mis-tag rate of 1\% 
(where ``light'' means $u$, $d$ and $s$ quarks) and an efficiency in the 
range $60-70\%$ depending on the jet \pt. 

\subsection{Muons}

Muons are identified according to the Tight working point definition
($\sim$95\% efficiency) of the muon identification
algorithm~\cite{ref:muon-id}. The algorithm works to reject cosmic muons or 
muons from decays in flight for consideration in the analysis. 
A PF-based ``combined relative'' isolation~\cite{ref:muon-id} is determined 
within a cone size $\Delta R < 0.4$, and "$\Delta\beta$" corrections 
are applied to remove the effects of pileup. Table~\ref{tab:muon-id} summarizes the
identification and isolation requirements. 
%This object is used as a
%veto as part of the hadronic signal region definition, as described in
%Section~\ref{sec:vetoes}, and as part of the \mj control
%sample selection described in Section~\ref{sec:def-control-samples}.

\subsection{Photons}
%
Selected photons must satisfy the Tight working point definition 
($\sim$70\% efficiency) of the simple cut-based photon identification
algorithm~\cite{ref:photon-id-egamma}. Pile-up corrected isolation is 
determined within a cone size $\Delta R < 0.3$ using the PF-based 
isolation algorithm~\cite{ref:photon-id-egamma}. 
Table~\ref{tab:photon-id-egamma} summarises the identification
and isolation requirements.

\subsection{Electrons}

Electrons are identified according to the Veto working point
definition ($\sim$95\% efficiency) of the cut-based \verb!Egamma!
identification algorithm~\cite{ref:electron-id}. PF-based
isolation~\cite{ref:electron-isolation} is determined within a cone
size $\Delta R < 0.3$ and $\rho \times A_{\textrm{eff}}$ corrections
are applied to remove the effects of pileup. Table~\ref{tab:ele-id}
summarises the identification and isolation requirements. 
%This object

%\subsection{Single isolated tracks}
%W boson can be identified if they
%Leptonic decay products of W bosons will leave one single isolated track (SIT) 
%in the tracker. A single isolated track (SIT) can be used to identify W bosons through
%their leptonic decays: $\textrm{W} \ra \mu \nu$, $\textrm{W} \ra e
%\nu$, and $\textrm{W} \ra \tau (\ra \ell) \nu$. Also, single prong
%decays of the tau lepton can be identified: $\textrm{W} \ra \tau (\ra
%h^{\pm} + n\pi^{0})\nu$. A single isolated track comprises a charged
%PF candidate that satisfies the requirements listed in
%Table~\ref{tab:sit-id}. The relative track isolation is determined
%from the vectorial sum of neighbouring charged PF candidates within a
%cone $\Delta R < 0.3$ and satisfying $\Delta z (\textrm{candidate,PV})
%< 0.05\cm$ around the candidate isolated track. This object can be
%used to efficiently suppress the ``lost lepton'' background from W and
%\ttbar, as described in Section~\ref{sec:vetoes}. This definition is
%based on the one used in SUS-13-011 (``single lepton stop search with
%transverse mass'')~\cite{singleleptonstop}.

%\subsection{Missing transverse energy}
%
%Missing transverse energy, \met, is defined by the type-I corrected
%particle-flow (PF)-based MET algorithm~\cite{ref:MET-corrections}. The
%\met variable is only used in the following two cases: to define of
%the tranverse mass variable, \mt, which is in turn used as part of the
%selection criteria that define the \mj control sample, described in
%Section~\ref{sec:def-control-samples}; to define a cleaning filter
%applied after the \alphat requirement, as described in
%Section~\ref{sec:had-signal}.
